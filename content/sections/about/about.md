Welcome to my personal website ! It is the place where you can learn more about myself and my services. You can also find my blog in which I write articles about cybersecurity, digital and physical pentest.

As cyber attacks continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, it's more important than ever to stay informed and take proactive measures to safeguard your assets. The services I provide are made specifically in this regard. 

As I love to learn new things everyday, and love even more to share them, I decided to create a blog in the idea that everyone with the same passion as me, could find resources, help and guides in this immense and complex field.
